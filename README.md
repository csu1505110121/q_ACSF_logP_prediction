# q_ACSF_logP_prediction

This project is for accurate and efficient prediction of partition coefficient ($\log P$) encoding both entropy and polarization effects into descriptors. Armed with high-dimensional neural networks, satisfied results are achieved compared with state-of-art methods. 

## Architecture
```
